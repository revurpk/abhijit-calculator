# Abhijit muhurta calculator

Basic Formula for Calculating Abhijit Muhurat:
1. Determine the exact sunrise and sunset times for your specific location and date
2. Calculate the midpoint between sunrise and sunset (this gives you the exact midday point)
3. Abhijit Muhurat begins 24 minutes before this midpoint and ends 24 minutes after, making it a 48-minute window
